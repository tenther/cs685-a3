<h1>CS685 Assignment 3</h1>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>
All the code for the first question is in <a href="move_robot.py">this
file.</a> The three functions do_move_to_point, do_move_to_line, and
do_move_to_pose implement the assignment. I had a lot of trouble
getting these to run. Partly it was a matter of finding correct
constants. I ended up renting the Corke book mentioned in the notes
and used the same constants, which generally worked (except for
move_to_pose.) Here are details about each function.
</p>
<h4>Move to point</h4>
<p>This image shows several robots starting off in different poses and
moving to (0,0).  Their are arrows on the image to show the starting
and ending orientation of each robot.

<h4>Move to line</h4>
<p>This image show several robots starting in various places and
  moving to the line [1,1,0]. The thick
  dark dots show the line the robots are moving toward. The smaller
  dots show the robot paths.Their are arrows on the image to show the
  starting and ending orientation of each robot.

<h4>Move to pose</h4>
<p>
I had the most trouble with the move_to_pose function. I never did
actually get it to work properly. The pose doesn't change correctly. The first image shows the paths of
three robots moving to [20, 20, 90]. The second image shows the detail of the end position of the robots, they
are all oriented to 0 degrees, not 90. The images show multiple orientations along each line to
show the robots changing orientation (incorrectly, unfortunately.)

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>The code for this section is in <a href="field_potential.py">this
file.</a>  I chose make the distance from the obstacle at which point
the repulsion becomes 0 to be 5 m. The first image shows the potential
field with four robots starting at different places and making the way
to the goal. The attraction fields are represented by vector arrows
in each 1x1 box. It's a little hard to make out the vectors, but you
can make them out clearly in the details images.
</p>

<p>The first detail image show the track of the four robots meeting at
  the first obstacle and and working around it. It's a little
  hard to make out the robots. They are the small colored dots. Zooming
  in on the image in matplotlib make the field potential vectors clearer
  and the robot traces more obscure.</p>

<p>The second detail image show the goal with all robots arriving in
  roughly the same place. They don't meet in exactly the same place
  because the program stops with the robot is with 0.1 m of the goal.
  The vector at this point are less distinct because their intensity
  is proportional to the distance from the goal.
</p>
<img src="a3_field_potential_detail_2.png" width="1000" width="1000"/> 
<p>The third show the how two robots working around the southern edge
  of the second obstacle. You can see how there motion is jerky as the
  robot move from a potential field where the repulsion is zero, to
  where it is strong within 5 m of the edge of the obstacle.
